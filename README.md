## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- The vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance are likely to provide non-random amounts of variance to the model. Because the vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance have a significant impact on miles per gallon on the MechaCar prototype. Conversely, the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and All Wheel Drive (AWD) have p-Values that indicate a random amount of variance with the dataset.

- The slope of the linear model is not zero. The p-Value for this model, which is p-Value: 5.35e-11, this is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, the slope of the linear model is not zero.

- This linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes. Approximately 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model.
## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
-  The Suspension Coil dataset provided for the MechaCar contains the results of testing the weight capacities of multiple suspension coils from multiple production lots to determine consistency. The variance of the suspension coils cannot exceed 100 pounds per square inch (PSI) .
## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
- We can collect data for comparable models across all major manufacturers for past 5 years for the following metrics such as current price, the resale value, and annual cost of ownership....
- The null hypothesis can be MechaCar is priced correctly based on its performance of key factors for its genre. And the alternative Hypothesis is MechaCar is not priced correctly based on performance of key factors for its genre.
- We would use linear regression to test our hypothesis because we can see factors with higher correlations.
